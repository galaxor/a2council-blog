  alt: "A frame from the youtube stream showing a slide from the consultants' presentation.  On the slide is a map of downtown, with the parcels highlighted in these colors:  Green = \"Eligible for density premiums\".  Grey = \"Developed in the last 15 years*\".  Then, the ineligible parcels are divided into different City Zoning Districts.  Dark orange = \"D1 - Downtown Core\".  D2 = \"Downtown Interface\".  It looks like only about half the parcels are green - eligible for density premiums.  The note on \"Developed in the last 15 years*\" says \"* The development sites and parcels shown on this map are based on a preliminary list of all projects that the City has approved from 2008 to the present.  The map may not identify all of the parcels associated with a given project, and some projects are not shown.\"  Because this is cropped from a screenshot from the livestream, we can also see the caption at the bottom of the screen, \"10-a UDC Premiums Discussion\", and about half the city's seal is shown."

<span class="h-event">The next <span class="p-name">[Ann Arbor Planning Commission](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/planning/development-review/Pages/CityPlanningCommission.aspx) meeting</span> will be <time class="dt-start" datetime="2023-04-04T19:00-0400">Tuesday, April 4, 2023, at 7pm</time>.</span>

There's a thing on there that I'm worried about:  [A proposed new branch](#proposed-university-of-michigan-credit-union-at-2929-plymouth-road) of the [University of Michigan Credit Union](https://umcu.org/) at 2929 Plymouth Road, which is currently a weird [dingbat-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbat_%28building%29) office building that I used to work in.  I think a standalone drive-through credit union is one of the worst possible uses of this land.

Also on the agenda:  An [interesting-looking discussion](#discussion-of-downtown-development-premiums) about the development incentives that the city offers to downtown developers, and how they might be changed in order to achieve the results we want, such as more housing downtown.
