TC-1 is the [name of a new zoning category](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILlRxeuLxQM).  New-ish.  It is designed to encourage and/or require "[transit oriented development](https://www.transit.dot.gov/TOD)".  According to the proposal that passed it, "[The TC1 district is intended to require at least two-story buildings for sufficient density to support and sustain the existing transit system, encourage infill development, expand housing choices, and further the goals of the Master Plan](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4966621&GUID=4E34C6AE-E4A5-4DC4-B460-124B943D8D79&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=tc1)".

There are several areas of the city that were mentioned in the earliest discussions of TC-1 as places the city might want to proactively rezone to TC-1.  They are areas that are already well-served by buses, but are currently built to serve cars more than people, in the suburban style, with large parking lots, few homes, and poor walkability.  The city council hopes to transform these into walkable neighborhoods with more homes.

Some of these areas have already been rezoned and some of them haven't yet.  As of yet, no new buildings have been built according to the specifications of the TC-1 zone.

This article is an incomplete timeline of TC-1's adoption in the city.  It will be updated with new developments.

## [2021, June: TC-1 was approved as a new zoning category in 2021](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4966621&GUID=4E34C6AE-E4A5-4DC4-B460-124B943D8D79&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=tc1)

Here are some of the unique characteristics of this zoning category designed to encourage the development of dense, walkable neighborhoods:

* Buildings are required to have least two stories.
* Buildings must be situated on the sidewalk and not behind a sea of parking.
* Parking is limited -- there is a maximum amount of land area that may be devoted to parking.
* Car-oriented uses are not permitted -- uses like car dealerships or drive throughs.

Now that TC-1 exists, any property owner can petition the city council to rezone their property as TC-1, but also, the city council has planned, since the inception of TC-1, to proactively re-zone some corridors, to create a more walkable, residential, transit-oriented character in those neighborhoods to replace the suburban car-oriented construction there.  The corridors mentioned have been:  State/Eisenhower, East Stadium, Plymouth Road, and Washtenaw Ave.

## [2022, February: State and Eisenhower rezoning](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5397283&GUID=2EC24708-0186-4903-A17D-F8E67AB8C05D&Options=ID)

It took eight months between the creation of the district and the proactive rezoning of the first district.  My understanding is that these proactive rezonings require a lot of staff work, and input from the Planning Commission -- deciding which properties to include, getting the paperwork in order, sending notices to property owners, etc.

## [2022, October: The West Stadium and Maple rezoning](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5848468&GUID=2C93A7BD-8254-47C4-B6DA-8F34B104B038&Options=ID%7CText)

It took another eight months for the city to proactively rezone the next district.  This is the pace, and we were on pace.

## [2022, December: Distracted by Trivialities](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5950251&GUID=8012EC81-7710-4533-ACBF-2420591260FD&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=tc1)

After the successes of the first two zones, the city council got distracted by a question:  Everyone knows that the major purpose of TC-1 is that car-centric development is not allowed.  But the city council passed a resolution that presupposes: What if it was?  They were thinking that it would help people to live car-free if they could walk to a car rental place in their neighborhood, or help them live car-light lifestyles if they could walk to car repair shops.  It was a bad idea and a terrible time to lose focus.  With everyone knowing that the Plymouth rezoning was on the horizon, a delay would give an incentive to developers to redevelop their land in a car-centric way before the rezoning took place.  Nonetheless, the city council passed the "[Resolution to Direct Planning Commission Following Stadium/Maple Rezoning to TC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5950251&GUID=8012EC81-7710-4533-ACBF-2420591260FD&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=tc1)" in December of 2022.

That resolution actually had two purposes:  One was to add car-oriented uses to the definition of TC-1.  The other was to come up with some way to allow wider sidewalks on Stadium/Maple, where some of the sidewalks are build unfortunately narrow.  One solution, of course, would be to narrow the roadway there, take away a lane for cars, and give that space back to humans.  Instead, they wanted a solution that would require property owners to have wider offsets where the city built the sidewalk too narrow.  This would not immediately fix the problem, since the city can't build anything on this private property, but it would put the city in a stronger bargaining position to negotiate some sort of easement agreement from these property owners:  "Say, since you can't build anything there anyway for some reason, how about you let us build there??"

## [2023, June: City Council Attempts to Refocus](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6209367&GUID=44D663AF-6101-455A-A051-1F688B316342&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search=tc1)

These were both tweaks that didn't require immediate attention, but as a result of this resolution, it became the top priority for the Planning staff and Planning commission.  In June of 2023, the city council realized that they had made an error in allowing this to delay the proactive rezonings.  They passed a [Resolution Directing the Planning Commission to Prioritize Rezoning of the Plymouth and Washtenaw Corridors to TC1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6209367&GUID=44D663AF-6101-455A-A051-1F688B316342&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search=tc1).  But it was too late.  Six months had already been wasted.

The tweaks were eventually passed.

## [2023, August: TC-1 was updated to allow some car-oriented uses](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6300535&GUID=63B41C04-F68A-4B18-9E57-0F1FEB13B1DF&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=tc1)

The proposal that came back, after being worked on by staff and Planning Commission for eight months, allowed car sales - one of the worst possible uses for land.  The reasoning was that the city council had wanted to include car repair, and a lot of the places that do car repair also include car sales -- whether it be a dealership that does repairs, or a repair place that sells the occasional car.

The city council assured us, though, that this change would not allow the types of car dealerships you see a lot.  That is, even though you were permitted to conduct the activity of car sales here, you would still have to build at least two stories, would be limited in the amount of parking you could provide, and would have to build your building right up next to the sidewalk.  This was not a blank check to build a sea of parking filled with cars for sale.  It seems unlikely to me that anyone would want to conduct business in this way, rather than build a traditional car dealership out in the townships.

## [2023, December: TC-1 was updated to address the narrow sidewalks](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6393399&GUID=0A64E817-8471-4AC5-A8C3-68FA299DEFB0&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=tc1)

Remember, the purpose of this change was to address a few properties along W Stadium which had narrow sidewalks and not enough space to build things like bus shelters or street trees.  Rather than promise to narrow the part of the roadway that's available to cars here, they wanted to require buildings to be built further from the sidewalk here, so that the city could negotiate easements to place bus shelters or street trees on the private property.

Remember, though, that wide setbacks also go against one of the goals of TC-1, which is to require buildings to be built right up to the sidewalk.  That makes buildings more inviting to pedestrians, makes the street more interesting to pedestrians pasisng by.  In addition, having buildings closer to the road causes drivers to drive more slowly and safely.

The staff and planning commission came up with a way to require wide setbacks where the current sidewalk was insufficiently wide, while requring narrow setbacks where the sidewalk was sufficient.  The plan was that the required setback would be required to be at least 18 feet from the **curb** and no more than 28 feet.  Normally, setbacks are measured from the property line.  By measuring from the curb, the setback would be self-adjusting.  If there was sufficient sidewalk width, the building would have to be built close to the sidewalk.  Where there was not enough sidewalk width, the building would have to be built further back.

It's a clever solution.  But it delayed work on rezoning the other potential TC-1 corridors, and did not need to be addressed so urgently.

## [2023, December: The First Reading of the Ordinance to Rezone Plymouth Road](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6444757&GUID=C400831E-A138-44E6-A0DC-124440C67F48&Options=&Search=)

Finally, at this last city council meeting, we had [the first reading of the ordinance to rezone the Plymouth Road corridor to TC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6444757&GUID=C400831E-A138-44E6-A0DC-124440C67F48&Options=&Search=).  The second reading of this ordinance won't happen until the first meeting of 2024, meaning that no properties were proactively rezoned to TC-1 in 2023.

If the city council hadn't been distracted by those tweaks, and if this rezoning followed the schedule of being done eight months after the last one, we would have expected this rezoning to be finalized in June of 2023.  Since it won't happen until January of 2024, we can see that we lost seven months by being distracted.  I hope that the city council has learned an important lesson about staff capacity and about being clear about priorities.

What did we lose by this delay?  [The University of Michigan Credit Union has had a by-right site plan approved by staff for a one-story, car-oriented bank at 2929 Plymouth Road](https://stream.a2gov.org/EnerGov_Prod/selfservice/AnnArborMIProd#/plan/c8446849-cfb1-442c-b3d9-f72a046ced9d), which is currently zoned "Office".  At least [the Planning Commission denied their application to make a drive-through](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6027309&GUID=E23F61D0-A17F-4065-B240-E3A3F88CCA78&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=2929+Plymouth+Road).  This will remain a car-oriented building with no residential use for many decades.

Finally, at the last city council meeting, while the TC-1 rezonings were approved, several properties were excluded.  These are properties that were added to [the proposal at the Planning Commission meeting of 2023-11-01](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6392444&GUID=10606E80-251E-4B29-9BDA-C240C27F1CDF&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=plymouth+road). Staff believed that these property owners would not need to receive a special notice about the plan to rezone their property because they had already received a notice about the public hearing for the Plymouth Road rezoning proposal in general.  This turned out to be a false assumption, and so those properties had to be removed by the city council at this meeting.

[During public comment for this meeting, the property owner stated their intention to use their property for some unspecified car-oriented purposes that would be prohibited by TC-1](https://youtu.be/NdtAHyM55vs?t=1400).  I hope their properties can be proactively rezoned to TC-1 before something permanent can be built there which would be detrimental to the community.

But, most of the Plymouth Road corridor will probably be rezoned at the Second Reading, at [the next meeting of the city council](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1141229&GUID=D3B804BB-C297-4866-9CA3-FD5B424BC41E&Options=info%7C&Search=), on January 8, 2024.

And I hope that the Washtenaw Avenue rezoning will follow shortly thereafter.

And I hope that the properties that were removed from the Plymouth Road rezoning are rezoned in a separate proposal.

And I hope that nothing terrible gets built here before those things are done.
