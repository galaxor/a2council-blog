<span class="h-event">The <span class="p-name">Ann Arbor City Council met</span> on <time class="dt-start" datetime="2023-04-17T19:00-0400">Monday, April 17, 2023</time>.</span>

We finally got to see the city administrator's [budget presentation]().  I'll walk you through it and give my thoughts.  The contract for the comprehensive land use plan update was approved, with strong language about redressing segregation in our new plan, and also with the assumption that we will be creating density.  Also, the 415 W Washington rezoning and concept plan were approved.

## Jude Walton

Jude Walton was a community activist who was [recently murdered](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2023/04/jude-walton-slain-ann-arbor-community-leader-remembered-for-welcoming-spirit.html).  She was a founding member of the [Independent Community Police Oversight Commission](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Boards-and-Commissions/Pages/Independent-Community-Police-Oversight-Commission.aspx).  She worked for [Avalon Housing](https://avalonhousing.org/), a nonprofit which provides supportive services and subsidized housing to low-income people.  Many city council members mourned her loss, at the city council meeting.

Several councilmembers also thanked the police for [arresting a suspect](https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2023/04/man-54-charged-with-murder-in-strangulation-death-of-ann-arbor-woman.html).  I hope we don't take from this the lesson that the police have done their job and now the community is safe, and we must continue to pour all of the city's money into maintaining a large police force in order to keep us safe.

For one thing, the police did not keep Jude Walton safe.  This suspect is someone who has been sent to jail many times by the police, and that wasn't enough to keep Jude Walton safe.  To me, this seems like evidence that our system of police and jails is not sufficient at promoting safety, and it would be fruitless to add more of these things.

Instead, I believe that instead of continuing to pour money into this system that does not work, we should invest more in the type of programs that Jude Walton worked for - subsidized housing with supportive services.  Services that can provide treatment for mental health issues, help with substance use disorders, keep people safe, and help them be a part of the community.  Instead of police and jails, we could be [investing on more holistic solutions to public safety](https://www.brookings.edu/research/want-to-reduce-violence-invest-in-place/).

<a class="youtube" href="https://youtu.be/oaYHCuOpXPg?t=6709">Councilmember Cynthia Harrison (Ward 1) said it best</a>:

> This is a traumatic time for our entire community.  Fears could be potentially heightened at the moment and there will be temptation among some to hold up Jude Walton's death as a call to arms for communities to pull back on initiatives such as affordable housing that work to break the cycle of homelessness and poverty.  We have so many stories and data about the positive impacts of having a home on the lives of children and adults. We aren't going to let what occurred - as horriffic as it was - derail the decades of work that she engaged in and those that she advocated for.  What we must remember is that this is the act of one individual - a terrible, horriffic, and unimaginable act.  We must not use this individual act to foster hate against multiple groups:  People of color, the unhoused, returning citizens, people with a mental illness, and those who suffer from a substance use disorder.  The best way for all of us to honor Jude, who was a pillar of our community, is to lift up the cause of affordable housing, which she spent 14 years fighting for.  We can honor her legacy and uplift her spirit by supporting the work that she did and by supporting initiatives that provide housing, which everyone deserves.

## Proclamations

There were two proclamations of observance periods made at this meeting:

* [April is Arab American Heritage Month](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6122669&GUID=A60D50F9-6DE1-46B3-8487-D4AF094853E2&Options=&Search=)
* [April 28 is Workers Memorial Day](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6172767&GUID=4ECD1DA9-B4CD-4AC2-9408-BB4A7618CB23&Options=&Search=), [to honor those who were injured on the job](https://aflcio.org/about-us/conferences-and-events/workers-memorial-day) and redouble our efforts to promote workplace safety, through things like unions.

## Presentation of the City Administrator's [Proposed Budget](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6122664&GUID=6B3491D0-5C3A-45CC-90E4-3FFE304AA06B&Options=&Search=)

[City Administrator Milton Dohoney](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-administrator/Pages/CityAdministratorsOffice.aspx) has prepared a proposed budget for the city for FY 2024-2025.  This is important because budgets are moral documents.  Whatever goes into the city's budget is the things we actually care about, as a community.  Watch what we're funding, not what we say.

This is just the initial proposal.  The city council will be discussing this budget and proposing amendments soon, in coming meetings.  Keep your eyes on it!  [The city council will pass the final budget](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/finance-admin-services/financial-reporting/budget-guide/Pages/BudgetPublicProcess.aspx) at its [second meeting in May (Monday, May 15)](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062173&GUID=74EEC7D8-359A-4593-ABC9-46B99E70F86B&Options=info%7C&Search=).  So there is still time to [contact city council](mailto:CityCouncil@a2gov.org) and share your thoughts on this budget.  There will also be a public hearing on the budget, presumably in its [first meeting in May (Monday, May 1)](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062172&GUID=D4D03A3F-E36B-4793-B34E-6EFB3400D073&Options=info%7C&Search=).

This presentation only covers a small portion of the budget, and doesn't have the charts and tables of numbers that I would expect.  I looked on the city's [budget process page](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/finance-admin-services/financial-reporting/budget-guide/Pages/BudgetPublicProcess.aspx), and it has a bunch of interesting video presentations listed from various departments, but I couldn't find a summary table.  Some of the individual departments have their presentations available for download as PDFs, at least.

But let's see what the city administrator chose to highlight in his presentation at this meeting.

### State Revenue Sharing

An important constraint that the city is operating under is that [state revenue sharing](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/finance-admin-services/financial-reporting/budget-guide/Pages/StateSharedRevenue.aspx) is not going up, so we're on our own.  The state revenue sharing is money that the state gives to municipalities.  It comes from the sales taxes that the state collects.  Since the 90s, Republicans have been reducing the amount of money that the state shares with municipalities.  Back in the day, the city had the voters approve a certain property tax amount for its operating millage, but didn't even need to collect that entire amount, because the state revenue sharing paid for so much.  But since then, the amount that the state shares has decreased, so the city has had to collect increasingly large percentages of its operating millage.  If you've noticed your property taxes increasing over the decades, this is why.  I had hoped that, with Democrats back in control of the state legislature, we might see that trend reverse, but not yet.

### Pension Fund 

Our pension fund is 90% funded - better than most pension funds!  That means we don't have a big burden to pay these pensions out of our general fund.

### Public Restrooms

The city administrator proposes building some downtown restrooms using $200k from the money the city got from the federal government as part of the [American Rescue Plan Act](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5534294&GUID=E5B3011D-DF6A-474F-A18E-AC754BA50E6E&Options=ID%7CText%7C).  We will be using stalls from the ["Throne" company](https://www.thronelabs.co/).  The city will be working with the [Downtown Development Authority](https://www.a2dda.org/) to figure out where to place them.  Personally, I hope that [Liberty Plaza](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/parks-places/Pages/LibertyPlaza.aspx) is one of those locations, and that it has a needle bin in it.  [AAATA](https://www.theride.org/) is also involved, so drivers have a place to pee while they're on their route.

### 121 E Catherine St

In 2019, the city council passed [a resolution asking the Ann Arbor Housing Commission to evaluate all city-owned land for potential development of subsidized housing](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3903308&GUID=38598520-B6EE-4907-878A-D523E72D50FD&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search=housing&FullText=1).  After undertaking the analysis, the [Ann Arbor Housing Commission](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Housing/Pages/default.aspx) came back with [its recommendations](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4218095&GUID=FE93751E-7D9B-4B45-8D74-575095A4AA75&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=R-19-138).  They said that 121 E Catherine St is their top priority to develop this parking lot as subsidized housing (63 apartments).

But that's not why this deserves a special mention in the budget.  There is plenty of money to develop this lot in this way.  Chiefly, by having the Ann Arbor Housing Commission apply for federal [Low Income Housing Tax Credits](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lihtc.html), which they don't need, since this is city-owned property which will not owe property taxes.  But they sell these tax credits at below-face-value to other companies to reduce their tax burden.  This is the main method that subsidized housing is funded in the city.  Another way that the city might get money for the development at 121 E Catherine St is using the [Affordable Housing Millage](https://www.mlive.com/politics/2020/11/early-results-show-support-for-new-ann-arbor-affordable-housing-sidewalks-taxes.html) that was approved by voters in 2020.

The reason this has a special line item in the budget is that the first floor of 121 E Catherine St is planned to be a community center to promote African American cultural and entrepreneurial pursuits.  This fits with the history of the neighborhood, which has been the part of time with a high African American population, and has been a center of the community.  This area also continues to be host to the [African American Downtown Festival](https://www.a2festival.org/) every year.  This year, the <span class="h-event"><span class="p-name">African American Downtown Festival</span> is happening on <time class="dt-start" datetime="2023-06-03T09:00:00-0400">June 3, 2023</time>, at <span class="p-location">4th and Ann St</span></span>.

To build the community center means doing neighborhood outreach, and that means hiring people and doing work.  Therefore, $150k is allocated in the budget to build this community organization.

### Bicentennial Celebration

2024 is [Ann Arbor's bicentennial](https://www.a2gov.org/news/pages/article.aspx?i=948).  The city is planning to do a bunch of stuff for the bicentennial celebration.  Seemingly a *lot* of stuff, since the city administrator is proposing to spend $200k in the FY 2024 budget and another $200k in the FY 2025 budget.

What will this money be funding?  It sounds like the biggest expense will be upgrades to [Fuller Park](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/parks-places/Pages/Fuller.aspx), which will be renamed "Bicentennial Park".  The new amenities that the city administrator mentioned were:

* A universal access splash pad
* Geothermal heating and cooling for the indoor structures
* A sculpture to honor former Olympians
* Sensory trails
* A Sculpture to pay tribute to indigenous land holders.

The way I see it, if we really want to pay tribute to indigenous land holders, we ought to actually give them their land back.  We could deed fuller park to the Saginaw Chippewa.  Maybe if we ask nicely, they'll let us rent the land from them to use as a park, but once we've given it to them, it's theirs to do with as they please.  In my view, that would be the best way to honor this community.

Unarmed response: $3.5M from ARPA.  $250k from marijuana $$$ in each of FY23, 24, 25.  What is the status of this program???  Ask CROS maybe?  Ask CM Song? (She made sure it was ARPA-funded) or CM Harrison (interested in this issue)

### Downtown Safety

Downtown safety:  They want walking teams downtown with fire-EMS, and "supportive connections".  Great idea except the police.  Ppl won't talk when they're around and won't get their needs met.  Cops will take notes on ppl & use it to oppress their community.


### Election Center

City Administrator Dohoney says he wants to buy a new building

A new building for the city to buy or build:  Election Center + CTN + Emergency Operations Center. 7-fig land transaction. $300k annual expense.  9 days early voting. EOC would run during storms, vice president visits, etc.  Violent fascist uprisings???

### Compensation Study

They're gonna do a study, $150k, about compensation, to make us competitive and equitable. We need good staff.  We need to hire & retain them.

### Better Office for Supportive Connections

"Supportive Connections" moved from 4th flr courthouse to 1st flr city hall.  Using opioid settlement $ to remodel.  Toynbee Idea: Safe consumption center.

### Redevelop City Hall

Redevelop city hall, with market-rate development?  Use less office space cuz WFH.

### Market-Rate Development at the Kline Lot

Market-rate development at the Kline lot?????  What did AAHC say?  Too big for all-subsidized housing.  Maybe split the land up like Veridian or 5th/William Y lot??

### Defund the Police??

I'm not hearing enough about defunding the police!

### Unallocted $1M

$1M marijuana tax unallocated.  What to do with it???
Do yr duty by smoking more marijuana.  Marijuana tax revenue did not increase.

## Comprehensive Plan Update

CA-14: Comprehensive Plan update.  Explicitly about more housing, and redressing segregation:
From the RFP: The City has contributed to racial and related segregation through decisions and investments over time. This work will acknowledge and accept this, and focus on reparative measures and policies that will seek to not only minimize such outcomes in the future, but undo damages of the past.

I hope public engagement will be representative & include ppl who live here as well as ppl who don't, but would want to.

## 415 W Washington [Zoning and Concept Plan](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6054963&GUID=41B151CE-10DE-4380-811B-79A5ADFADB3E&Options=&Search=)

B-1: 415 W Washington. "Pre-entitlement" - city clears the way for a private developer to do this.  We'll get $ for subsidized housing. We couldn't build subsidized here because of flood plain / flood way.  5 stories, 157 units, historic preservation, chimney swifts, soil remediation, treeline trail.

## Center of the City

Center of the City: Lots of speakers say it's time to put this mess out of its misery, after the staff memo about the feasibility of doing food trucks there.

## Gelman Litigation

CA-12: $150k for Gelman litigation:  Thresholds have been crossed where the court order says they need to build new monitoring wells & do stuff, but they didn't do it, so we need to launch an additional lawsuit.

CA-11: Earhart sidewalk.  This one is a no brainer, but people have been complaining about another sidewalk on Earhart.  City has a compromise that will narrow the road, put the sidewalk there, & remove fewer trees.

Water rate increases, to support water capital improvements. Some of that treatment plant is from the 1930s.
